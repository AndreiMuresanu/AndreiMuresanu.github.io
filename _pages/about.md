Hi, I'm Andrei. This September, I'll be starting my PhD at the University of Toronto, co-supervised by Professors Nicolas Papernot and Zhijing Jin. My research interests lie in interpretability, with a long-term goal of developing mathematically provable AI safety guarantees.

I previously earned a dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Waterloo and have interned at Nvidia. Currently, I serve as the CTO of WealthyPlanet and a founding PI at Silera.ai.
